name: Feature Request
about: Tell us about a new feature that you would like to see in xdis

---

## Description

<!-- Add a short description of the feature. This might
include same input and output. -->

## Background

<!-- Add any additional background for the
feature, for example: user scenarios, or the value of the feature. -->

## Priority

<!-- If this is important for a particular public, state that here.
     If this is blocking some important activity let us know what activity it blocks.
	 If you are asking about a release because you are packing for a distribution like Ubuntu or Fedora, BlackArch, say so. I generally make releases otherwise on whim or when I have a need, such as I am giving a talk. If you sponsor, the project your release request has greater importance.

	 Otherwise, we'll assume whatever is wrong or needed has the lowest priority in addressing.

## Tests
<!-- _This section is optional._

Add text with suggestions on how to test the feature,
if it is not obvious.
