6.1.0 2024-03-15
=================

Lots of changes major changes. API has changed.
We now support many disassembly options:
  * classic:  disasm-like output
  * bytes: disasm-like output with bytecode
  * extended: simple interpretation of previous sequence of instructions
  * extended-bytes: same as above, but with "bytes" bytecode output
  * header: show header/metadata information only

This is reflected in the `--format` (`-F`) options on `pydisasm`.
Option `--show-source` (`-S`) gives add the source text line (or part of it) before assembly instructions that implement the line.

Released Python magic numbers have been updated as of this release (up to Python 3.12.2, including PyPy magic numbers.

Some support for the [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/python/)
implementation of Python started.

Many bugs fixed.

A lot of Linting and coding style modernization.

typing.NameTuple used for Python versions that support this.
Additional fields "start_offset" and "tos_str" added to instruction.

* Fix some small lingering bugs introduced converting Python version number floats to tuples

6.0.0 2021-10-15
=================

Reworked for Python 3.10.

We had been internally using floating point numbers for version testing.
Clearly this doesn't work to distinguish 3.1 from 3.10.
(This was a flaw known about for a while that we had been avoiding).

* Add 3.9 and 3.10 testing.
* Some tolerance for running from 3.11
* Update magic numbers
* Expanding testing to include pyston and PyPy 3.7
* Improve distribution packaging, e.g. Python 3 wheels should no longer be attempted on Python 2.x

5.0.13 2021-09-24
=================

Added knowledge of Python versions 3.6.15 and 3.7.12.

However, the main motivation was to improve packaging to handle administration
of the 3 different branches or dialects of Python 2.4-2.7, 3.1-3.2, 3.3-3.5, and 3.6+

Restrict wheel packaging for Python 3 only.

Use the wheel for only the 3.x and newer version of Python.
Use eggs for 2.x versions (and others as well).


5.0.12 2021-09-11
=================

* Add Python version 3.9.7
* Document unmarshal better
* Correct stack information for `IMPORT_NAME`

================

* Add Python versions 3.9.6, 3.7.11, 3.8.11, and 3.6.14
* Format Python various files using black. (Not completely done yet though)

5.0.10 2021-06-16
================

- Note Python versions 3.8.10 and 3.9.5
- Incorrect variable name in marshal dump (used in writing `.pyc` files). PR #75

5.0.9 2021-04-16
================

In general, better Python 3.9 support.

- Improve 3.9 `IS_OP` and `CONTAINS_OP` operand formatting
- Correct disassembly of 3.9 bytecode from other bytecode
- Accept 3.9.3 and 3.9.4 as a valid 3.9 version
- Accept 3.8.9 as a valid 3.8 version

5.0.8 2021-03-13
================

- PR #73 from mitre:
  Allow an alternate opmap - adds the capability to disassemble python bytecode that has
  been frozen with a custom opcode mapping. This is particularly useful for disassembling
  malware that uses custom opcode mappings in an attempt to hinder disassembly with standard
  tools. The updates in this pull request are used by pydecipher, a tool to unfreeze and deobfuscate frozen python code.

- Add Python versions 3.8.8 and 3.9.2

5.0.7 2021-01-10
================

* Add Python 3.8.7

5.0.6 2020-12-16
================

* Add Python 3.9.1

5.0.5 2020-10-27
================

* Add support for Python2.7 on Ubuntu 20.04
* Bump versions for Python 3.8.6 and 3.5.10
* Release instructions moved to wiki
* `VERSION` -> `__version__` because Python prefers it that way

5.0.4 2020-08-30
================

* Add python versions 3.6.12, 3.7.9
* extended arg disassembly handling for `LOAD_ATTR` and `STORE_ATTR`

* Update 3.9 magics and opcodes

5.0.2 2020-07-25
================

* Add Python 3.8.4 as a 3.8 release
* pydisasm.py Python 3.3 tolerance
* Make pydoc's version reporting show xdis's version

5.0.1 2020-06-28
================

Two small improvements that are useful in the forthcoming [trepan3k](https://pypi.org/project/trepan3k) release:

* interpret `RAISE_VARARGS`'s `argc` parameter. Some other formatting was extended too
* `check_object_path()` is more lenient in the path name (it doesn't have to end in `.py` anymore), but it is
   more stringent about what constitutes Python source (it compiles the text to determine validity)
* In the above `is_python_source()` and `is_bytecode_extension()` are used. They are also exported.


5.0.0 2020-06-27
================

Disassembly format and options have simplified and improved.

I had this "Aha!" moment working on the cross-version interpreter x-python. It can show a better disassembly because it has materialized stack entries.
So for example when a `COMPARE_OP` instruction is run it can show what operands are getting compared.

It was then that I realized that this is also true much of the time statically. For example, you'll often find a `LOAD_CONST` instruction before a `RETURN_VALUE` and when you do can show exactly what is getting returned. Although cute, the place where something like this is most appreciated and needed is in calling functions such as via `CALL_FUNCTION`. The situation here is that the name of the function is on the stack, and it can be several instructions back depending on the number of parameters. However, in a large number of cases, by tracking use of stack effects (added in a previous release), we can often location the `LOAD_CONST` of that function name.

Note though that we don't attempt work across basic blocks to track down information. Nor do we even attempt to recreate expression trees. We don't track across call which has a parameter return value which is the return from another call. Still, I find this all very useful.

This is not shown by default though. Instead, we use a mode called "classic". To get this, in `pydisasm` use the `--format extended` or `--format extended-bytes`.

And that brings up a second change in formatting. Before, we had separate flags and command-line options for whether to show just the header, and whether to include bytecode ops in the output. Now there is just a single parameter called `asm_format`, and choice option `--format` (short option `-F`).

As a result this release is incompatible with prior releases, hence the version bump.

A slight change was made in "classic" output. Before we had shown the index into some code table, like `co_consts` or `co_varnames`. That no longer appears. If you want that information select either the `bytes` or `extended-bytes` formats.

A bug was fixed in all offsets in the recently-added `xdis.lineoffsets` module.


4.7.0 2020-06-12 Fleetwood66
============================

Routines for extracting line and offset information from code objects was added.

Specifically in module `xdis.lineoffsets`:
	* classes:	`LineOffsetInfo`, `LineOffsets`, and `LineOffsetsCompact`
	* functions: `lineoffsets_in_file()`, `lineoffsets_in_module()`

This is need to better support debugging which is done via module
pyficache.

In the future, I intend to make use of this to disambiguate which offset to break at when there are several for a line.  Or to indicate better which function or module the line is located in when reporting lines.

For example in:

```python
  z = lambda x, y: x + y
```

there two offsets associated with that line. The first is to the assignment of `z` while the second is to the addition expression inside the lambda.

In other news, a long-standing bug was fixed to handle bytestring constants in 3.x. We had been erroneously converting bytestrings into 3.x. However, when decompiling 1.x or 2.x bytecode from 3.x we still need to convert bytestrings into strings.

Also, operand formatting in assembly for `BUILD_UNMAP_WITH_CALL` has been improved, and
we note how the operand encoding has changed between 3.5. and 3.6.

Disassembly now properly marks offsets where the line number that doesn't change from the previous entry.

4.6.1 2020-05-30 Lady Elaine
============================

The main purpose of this release is to support x-python better.

* Fix a bad bug in handling byte constants in 3.x. How could this go so long fixed?
* More custom formatting across more opcodes
   * `CALL_FUNCTION`, `CALL_FUNCTION_KW`, `CALL_FUNCTION_VAR`, etc
   * `MAKE_FUNCTION`
   * `LOAD_CONST` in some cases
* Go over magics numbers, yet again
* Update *See also* links

4.6.0 2020-05-18 Décadi 30th Floréal - Shepherd's Crook
=======================================================

The major impetus for this release is expanding the Python in Python interpreter [x-python](https://pypi.org/project/x-python/)
(A new release of that will go out after this.)

* 3.8.3 added as a valid 3.8 release
* command program `pydisasm` disassembles more Python source files now
* Add better argument formatting on `CALL_FUNCTION` and `MAKE_FUNCTION`
* bytecode.py now has `distb`
* opcode modules now have variable `python_implementation` which is either "CPython" or "PyPY"
* Reformat a number of files using blacken, and lint using flymake
* Update `__init__.py` exports based on what is used in projects `uncompyle6`, `decompyle3`, `trepan3k`,
  `xasm` and `x-python`
* Remove duplicate `findlinestarts()` code. Remove testing on the Python version and simplify
  this where possible.
* get_opcode_module allows either a float and string datatype for the version, and converts
  the bytecode datatype when needed
* Fix a bugs in marshal and unmarshal

See the commit history or ChangeLog file for a full list of changes


4.5.1 2020-04-26 stack_effects redux
====================================

* Fix bug in marshal for 3.8+ (include posonlyargcount)
* Go over stack effects from 2.5 to 3.4 using and idea from Maynard
* Expand stack-effect testing

4.5.0 2020-04-20 stack_effects
==============================

* `stack_effects()` checked against Python 3.4+ is now in place.
* Added `stack_effects()` function to `std.py` since this is part of the API
* `cross_xdis.py` file/module now has `dis.py` functions split off from `bytecode.py`
* `Instructions` class is in its own module too.
* Python 2.7.18 added into magics.

Incompatibility with earlier versions:

Note: as a result of the reorganization, exported functions from
bytecode are now in cross_dis.  However, functions are exported from
the top-level so use that and there will be no disruption in the
future. For example `from xdis import iscode, instruction_size,
code_info`.

4.4.0 2020-04-20 modern-pitch A
===============================

Incompatibility: `load_module()` and `load_module_from_file_object()` now return a couple more parameters: is_pypy, and the sip_hash value when that is available. The timestamp and file_size returned on these functions is now None when they aren't available. Previously timestamp had been 0.

* --asm option fixes
* Show sip hash in 3.7+ when that is used
* Handle PEP 552 bytecode-file variations more properly
* Detect more intermediate Python versions in `load_code_from_file_object()`
* 3.8+ posonlyargcount in assembly...  rename Kw-only field to Keyword-only
* Add 3.5 canonic bytecode version Marshal `dumps()`
* convert from byte() to str() in dumps() when needed in 3.x
* to_native() convert to bytes from string when needed in 3.x.
* clean up loading code by using float version values rather than magic values

4.3.2 2020-04-16 portable code type
===================================

Fix a few more bugs caused by the recent portability refactoring

* back off line-number table decompression for Python < 3.0 for now. This breaks decomplation.
* bytecode fix for cell_names now that code types are more stringent.


4.3.1 2020-04-16
===================================

Fix bug in handling Python 3.8 bytecode.

Sadly, I inadvertently wasn't testing 3.8 bytecode before. That's now fixed too.

Release revoked - use 4.3.2

4.3.0 2020-04-16
===================================

Release revoked - use 4.3.2

Portable Code Type
------------------

A portable version of types.CodeType was rewritten, to make it

* easier to use
* and catch more errors
* more complete in tracking Python `types.CodeType` changes
* simpler in implementation by using type inheretence
* more general

Previously getting bytecode read from a bytecode file or from a code object requiring knowing a lot about the Python version of the code type and of the currently running interpreter. That is gone now.

Use `codeType2Portable()` to turn a native `types.CodeType` or a structure read in from a bytecode file into a portable code type. The portable code type allows fields to be mutated, and is more flexible in the kinds of datatypes it allows.

For example lists of thing like `co_consts`, or `varnames` can be Python lists as well as tuples. The line number table is stored as a dictionary mapping of address to bytecode offset rather than as a compressed structure. Bytecode can either be a string (which is advantageous if you are running Python before 3.x) or a sequence of bytes which is the datatype of a code object for 3.x.

However, when you need a `type.CodeType` that can be `eval()`'d by the Python interpreter you are running, use the `to_native()` method on the portable code type returned. It will compress and encode the line number table, and turn lists into tuples and convert other datatypes to the right type as needed.

If you have a *complete* `types.Codetype` structure for a particular Python version whether, it is the one the current Python interpreter is using or not, use the `to_portable()` function, and it will figure out based on the version parameter supplied (or use the current Python interpreter version if none supplieed), which particular portable code type is the right one.

If on the other hand, you have a number of code-type fields which may be incomplete, but still want to work with something that has code-type characteristics while not worrying about which fields are required and their exact proper datatypes, use the `CodeTypeUnion` structure.

Internally, we use OO inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicate code. The `load_code_internal()` function from `unmarshal.py` is now a lot shorter and cleaner as a result of this reorganization.

### New Portable Code Methods, Modules and Classes

* Python 3.8-ish `replace()` method has been added to the portable code types
* Portable code type classes `Code13`, `Code15` have been added to more precisely distinguish Python 1.3 and 1.5 code types. The other portable code classes are `Code2`, `Code3`, and `Code38`.
* the to_native() converts a portable code type into a native code type
* the `decode_lineno_tab()` method on portable code types from Python 1.5 on decompresses the Python encode line number table into a dictionary mapping offset to line number.


Incompatibility
---------------

The module `xdis.code` has been remamed to `xdis.codetype` and with that the function `iscode()` moved as well. In previous versions to use `iscode()` you might import it from `xdis.code`; now simply import it from `xdis`. In general function that had been imported from a module under `xdis` can now be imported simply from `xdis`.

The classes `Compat3Code` and function `code2compat()` and `code3compat()` have been removed. `Compat2Code` is still around for dropbox 2.5, but that is deprecated and will be removed when I can figure out how to remove it from dropbox 2.5.

Other Changes
-------------

CI testing for older testing has been fixed now that 2.7 is even more deprecated.

  and the value is its canonic versions string, e.g. '2.7'

3.6.2 2017-12-02

- Add canonic 3.2, 3.2a2, in op_imports
- Handle {-,}nan and {-,}inf in bytecode print attributes

3.6.1 2017-11-10
=====================

- Improve --asm option: disambiguate code objects with the same co_name
- Update canonic versions 3.6.3, 3.5.4, etc.
- "std" API now uses get_opcode_module rather than get_opcode()
- Add function extended_arg_val and use it in unpack_opargs_bytecode()
- str2version(): canonicalize version before float
- str2float(): We now at least detect inter-python version magic changes and
  can return something like 3.54 for 3.5.4  This assumes there never will be a 3.51

3.6.0 2017-09-25
=====================

- StdApi now uses std functions and constants from the
  correctly generated opc rather than the standard dis module (moagstar)
- Improve accuracy of opcode stack effects; classify opcodes more correctly
- Regularize opcode names: pypy is at the end now
- Correct writing Python3 bytecode from Python2 and Python2 bytecode from Python 3
- Add function to load from file object
- Add EXTENDED_ARG_SHIFT the number of bit positions EXTENDED_ARGS shifts
  This varies depending on where we are with respect to Python 3.6; similarly
  add ARG_MAX_VALUE, the maixumim integer value an operand field can have before
  needing EXTENDED_ARGS
- add unpack_opargs_bytecode which is similar to unpack_opargs_wordcode of 3.6
  This probably fixes a long-standing but little-noticed bug in Python 2.x disassembly
- cross version compatibility bug fixed in code2num()
- Mark NOFOLLOW opcodes (RETURN, RAISE)
- Mark conditional opcodes (POP_JUMP_IF...)
- Add len() and getitem() to code types to mimic Python3 behavior
- More tests; add appveyor CI testing

3.5.5 2017-08-31
=====================

- Add 3.7 opcodes
- Add optional file parameter on load_file
- add functions code_has_star_arg and code_has_star_star_arg (from uncompyle6)

3.5.4 2017-08-15
=====================

- Add internal switch in findlabels() to show multiple offsets for a
  given line.  This is turned on in pydisasm --xasm mode. Otherwise, it
  is off. Sme  programs make use of findlinstart's somewhat misleading
  behavior

- Add methods for selecting from sys.version_info to the right opcode
  module, or canonic Python string or floating-point number.

- Add a notion of a canonic Python version.

- Add magic values for pyston and Jython.

- Some pyston tolerance. More is needed though.


3.5.3 2017-08-12
=====================

Showing all line number bolixes uncompyle6 and the trepan debuggers,
so nuke that for now.

However, we show the full deal in pydisasm for asm format.  Here it is important since we recreate the line number table based on information
given in the instructions.  We could and probably should allow showing all the line number in the default format as well.  Underneath there is a parameter to control that.

* Add pypy 3.5.3 magic number


3.5.2 2017-08-09
=====================

- magic to opcode for all known versions we handle
- simpiler import access to opcodes modules
- magic lookup for Python 3.3 is probably more correct more often

3.5.1 2017-07-14
=====================

Overall: Better xasm support, pydisasm improvements

- Was picking up wrong findlabels and findlinestarts in Python 3.5
- Add ARG_MAX_VALUE: the largest operand value before needing EXTENDED_ARG
- Allow lnotab as a dict before code freeze
- pydisasm: don't show Freevars more than once. Do show varnames,
  the combined positional + local vars
- change cmp_op values so that they don't have an embedded space
  this helps xasm tokenization of COMPARE_OP's operand
- --asm option fixes
- a frozenset is more appropriate for opcode sets

3.5.0 2017-07-08
=====================

Overall: Support for bytecode assembler (xasm), Better 3.4-3.6 support

- Add --xasm option to pydisasm. This will output a disassembly
  suitable for an assembler, specifically xasm.
- Add magic lookup for 3.4.[0..6] 3.5.[0..2] and 3.6.[0..1]
- Add magic lookup for base versions, e.g. 2.7 or 3.4
- Trap ill-formed python bytecode better
- Show timestamp in pydisasm output as it is stored
- Add "optype" field to Instructions. Derived from the has_xxx lists
- Marshaling for Python2 and Python3 code when using cross-version
  is aware that the format for the other type is different.
- Add opcode sets corresponding to the opcode has_xxx lists.
- Document Code2 and Code3 a little better
- add Code2Compat and Code3Compat to make cross-version Code creation
  easier
- add Code2/Code3 freeze() routine which converts from a
  programmer-friendly code object to one compacted and ready for
  marshalling or use.
- Correct Python 3.6+ findlinestarts() and findlabels() methods
- Fix _unpack_opargs_wordcode in 3.6
- DRY opcodes more
- Add marshal types that have appeared since Python 3.4 and
  start to implement. More work is needed here.


3.4.0 2017-06-25
=====================

- Add functions in xdis.bytecode:
  has_argument()_, next_offset(), and op_size() functions to
- work with fixed (3.6+) and variable-length (pre 3.6) instructions
